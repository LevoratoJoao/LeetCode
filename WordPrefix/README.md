# 1455. Check If a Word Occurs As a Prefix of Any Word in a Sentence

## Built-in Functions:

Split the sentence and then use startswith() to check if the word is a prefix of any word in the sentence and thats it.

Time complexity: O(n * w + m) where n is the size of the sentence, m is the size of the searchWord and w the total number of words in the sentence.

Space complexity: O(n) where n is the size of the sentence.

## Two Pointers:

This would be the best solution but I am not going to implement it because it is not necessary.

Time complexity: O(n * w + m) where n is the size of the sentence, m is the size of the searchWord and w the total number of words in the sentence.

Space complexity: O(1)
